# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-01)

**Core value:** Every agent action is intercepted at runtime and returned an explainable, graduated decision grounded in policy + a human-readable constitution, with tamper-evident audit evidence — making unsafe agent behavior structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Walking Skeleton

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Walking Skeleton) — EXECUTING

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 14 fine-grained vertical-slice phases. Phases 1–6 = Phase-0 parity loop, 7–12 = Phase-1 substrate, 13–14 = hard-gated Phase-2 moonshot.
- [Roadmap]: P0-killer invariants wired into early phases as acceptance criteria — contract-first (Phase 1), latency budget + no-silent-allow + own-cache + advisory-only interpreter + trust-modulates-only (Phase 3), fail-closed redaction + CI verifier + anchoring (Phase 4).
- [Roadmap]: Phase 14 is explicitly gated on the full P0/P1 substrate passing verification (latency held, audit externally verifiable, coverage matrix green, red-team gating CI).
- [Phase 1]: [01-01] Contract package built first with zero internal dependencies (D-08/PIPE-07) — the stable serializable boundary every PEP form plugs into.
- [Phase 1]: [01-01] Audit store seam is SQLite-backed (D-14 no-Docker deviation); opa-wasmtime/wasmtime gated to plan 01-04 (A1), not installed this wave.
- [Phase 1]: [01-02] EdDSA (Ed25519) JWT identity engine — verify uses explicit algorithms=[EdDSA] allowlist (GHSA-ffqj-6fqr-9h24), iss+sub+registered checks (IDN-01/IDN-02 seed).
- [Phase 1]: [01-02] Hash-chained audit writer (AUD-01): monotonic hash-covered seq, prev_hash links, canonical JSON, fail-closed redaction (D-15); SQLite Store, Postgres models retained as production target (D-14).

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Research-flagged spikes likely needed at plan time: Phase 3 Constitution→YAML→Rego compiler fidelity/precedence; Phase 4 audit external-anchoring + fail-closed-redaction last gate; Phase 8 ASI05/06/07 detector design; Phase 7 multi-node cache invalidation; all of Phases 13–14 (LOW-confidence moonshot tech — evaluate before commit).
- Competitive framing is parity-with-AGT (not "beats AGT"); the four surviving differentiators (amendable Constitution, require_consensus→BFT, self-play, ZK proofs) live in later phases.
